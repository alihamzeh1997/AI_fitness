        f"I'm showing you {frames_per_second} frames per second, and every frame is annotated with a timestamp showing its exact position in the video.\n\n"

        "Your task is to analyze the user's movement by reviewing the frames in order, with close attention to the timestamps. Your analysis must be time-aware, not just based on visual similarities.\n\n"

        "The analysis consists of the following steps:\n\n"

        "1. **Exercise Identification**:\n"
        "- First, identify which exercise is being performed (e.g., squats, push-ups, lunges).\n"
        "- Use full-body positioning, involved joints, angles, and movement patterns over time to determine the exercise type.\n"
        "- Do not rely on the visual appearance of a single frame. Your identification must be based on how the user's body moves across time.\n\n"

        "2. **Repetition Counting**:\n"
        "- After identifying the exercise, determine when each repetition begins and ends.\n"
        "- A repetition is only considered complete when the user returns to the starting position of the movement.\n"
        "- It's especially important to correctly identify where in a rep the video starts ‚Äî the beginning, middle, or end.\n"
        "- To do this, go beyond visual comparison and conduct a **tempospatial analysis**: recognize which joints and body parts are involved in the exercise, then track their positioning and movement over time using timestamps.\n"
        "- Compare body posture across frames and infer movement trajectories to accurately detect rep boundaries.\n"
        "- Always look ahead to the next frames to confirm if a rep has truly ended. These are static frames sampled from a continuous video ‚Äî temporal context is essential.\n"
        "- Keep in mind that rep speed may vary during the workout. For example, the user might perform the first 3 reps at 2 seconds per rep, then slow down to 3 seconds or speed up to 1 second per rep.\n"
        "- **Never assume a fixed tempo or repetition pattern based on earlier reps**. Each rep must be analyzed independently based on timestamped frames.\n\n"

        "3. **Tempo Analysis**:\n"
        "- For each repetition, calculate its duration using the frame timestamps.\n"
        "- Categorize the tempo as slow, moderate, or fast based on time.\n"
        "- If the user changes tempo across the session, explicitly highlight this change and explain when and how it happens.\n\n"

        "4. **Form & Technique Evaluation**:\n"
        "- Throughout the exercise, assess the user's form: body posture, joint alignment, range of motion, balance, and stability.\n"
        "- Determine whether the user is performing the movement correctly, based on the standards of the identified exercise.\n"
        "- Flag any issues such as incomplete movement, poor control, or risky alignment (e.g., knees going too far forward, rounded back, lack of full extension).\n\n"

        "**Key Instructions:**\n"
        "- Always refer to specific frames and timestamps when making observations.\n"
        "- Your reasoning must be time-aware ‚Äî describe how the user's position evolves across time.\n"
        "- Avoid assumptions. If parts of the movement are unclear or missing from the video sample, explicitly state the limitations.\n"
        "- Use clear biomechanical and fitness-specific terminology wherever appropriate.\n\n"

        "Your response should reflect a detailed, timestamp-driven analysis of movement and should clearly tie all conclusions back to specific moments in the video."

        ### Example Analysis
        
        - **Exercise identified**: Bodyweight Squat
        
        - **Total repetition count (Detailed with timestamp)**:
          - Rep 1: 0.00s - 2.50s
          - Rep 2: 2.50s - 5.25s
          - Rep 3: 5.25s - 8.00s
          - Rep 4: 8.00s - 10.75s
          - Rep 5: 10.75s - 13.50s (partial rep)
        
        - **Tempo assessment**:
          - Average tempo: Moderate (approximately 2.5 seconds per rep)
          - Consistent timing throughout all completed repetitions
        
        - **Form evaluation**:
          - Good depth on all squats
          - Knees track over toes appropriately
          - Core remains engaged throughout
          - Minor forward lean at bottom position
          - Suggestion: Focus on maintaining more upright torso
        
        - **Reasoning for your analysis**:
          Analysis based on tracking hip and knee angles across timestamps. The exercise was identified as a bodyweight squat based on the characteristic downward/upward movement pattern with weight on both legs. Repetitions were counted by identifying the starting position (standing tall) and tracking the full movement cycle back to that position. Form assessment considered knee tracking, torso angle, and depth of the squat.
